# serpent-runtime

Work in progress tree that will eventually be refactored as part of a
larger (more standard) build system to bootstrap runtime requirements
for the [Serpent Game Framework](https://github.com/lispysnake/serpent).

Right now, it's a growing collection of ugly scripts that will simply
build the relevant runtime requirements, like bgfx.

**Note**: Due to my current internet limitations we fetch GitHub generated
`zip` files instead of using submodules like we should. Once my internet
behaves we'll fix it.

Additionally the scripts are severely context limited in believing you
only want to build for 64-bit Linux with GCC.

## Scripts

As and when new scripts are added (which ofc will be replaced in future..)
we'll document them here.

### bgfx

Fetch `bgfx`, `bimg` and `bx`, building them for a local deployment. Builds
the main release library, along with the `shaderc`, `texturec` and `texturev`
CLI tools.
